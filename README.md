# CS386-Team-Project

Our team is developing a text adventure game playable through an Android mobile platform. In our program, a player will be able to progress through a storyline leaving their own impact in an immersive world that allows the player to solve problems in creative and entertaining ways. We hope to give the player a chance to be able to focus on just the game and the story at hand. It will resolve boredom and offer an escape from reality.
