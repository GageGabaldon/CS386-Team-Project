You start booking away from the door scared that whatever lives here is not a friendly folk. Suddenly a voice whispers from your right ear, "Hey".
You startled by the voice slow down and notice that a puff of cloud is right next to you. Noticing the cloud was the one you spoke. You mutter "Hey".
The cloud then whispers again like a light wind, "What are you doing here".
