You gently walk over to the rope being extraordinarily careful when going to the edge. You peer over the structure and see a rope descending into a
very angry darkened sea. You don't see anything highly remarkable but for a lone buoy with a rather weak light to illuminate the dark ocean surrounding it.
While looking a mighty gust of wind sweeps you away from the edge and you flop right on the platform once more. Upon lying on the floor you notice a strange cloud formation above your platform.
