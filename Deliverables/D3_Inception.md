### System Description
  The problem of being bored and looking for an immersive gaming experience affects **players**; 
  the impact of which is being unable to find a game or experience that helps pass time. 
  TextAdventureGame is a text adventure game that immerses the **player** in a **story** in which 
  they can choose their own path or **story**. TextAdventureGame keeps users engaged by providing multiple 
  :choices: to the **player** that ultimately :decides: how the **story** plays out. TextAdventureGame encourages 
  creativity and personal choice to give **players** an open-ended story.
  
  The **player** will be able to choose a name for their character before starting the game. 
  A character has specific attributes such as their *health*, *inventory*, and current **location**. 
  Once in the game, the **player** will be presented with elements of the **story** that lead to the **player** 
  being presented a *choice*. The **player** will continue through the **story** making :choices: until the end 
  of the game is reached. Along the path of the **story** the **player** will be able to interact with and combat 
  **Non Playable Characters** through events that require another *choice*. The **NPCâ€™s** have their own attributes 
  such as *health* and **location**. The **player** will come across **items** that they can pick up and add to the
  *inventory*. These **items** may be used to affect other :choices: or change the **players** stats such as *health*.
  As a whole, there is a world that encapsulated the current position of the **story** which includes the 
  **player** and their attributes, as well as the current **location**. A separate class activities will handle the UI 
  and update what parts of the **story** are displayed on the current screen as well as the possible :choices:. 
  An **activities** and **update game** class will be used to update the UI and keep the :buttons: and other elements of
  the UI updated.
