The cloud person follows you as you fall towards the ocean and gives you something. He then remarks that you are the most agreeable human he talked to. "Use this to come visit sometime" and hands you a cloudy
amulet with adorned with the strange metal. The cloud person then says, "I can see that you have many questions and I see that I need to help you in the future and maybe you can help me too". You continue to fall and then as you hit the ocean you wake up.
Still confused with what has happened regard the events as a dream but as soon as you look down you see the cloudy amulet in your hand and realize it was real. You exhausted with the near death experience decide to leave the amulet be for now and go back to bed.
