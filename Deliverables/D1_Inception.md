Introduction:

We are developing a text adventure game. We want a immersive world that tries to help the player solve problems in creative and fun ways. We want to be able to give the player options to choose from that will ultimately impact what happens later on in the game. We hope to give the player a sense of escaping from reality and be able to focus on just the game and the story at hand.



Initial value proposition and consumer segments:

Inital value proposition is that for escapisim, need to create.



Interviews summary:

Interview 1:
I interviewed Brian Bingham at 9:30 pm on February 14, 2020. I talked with Brain about our text adventure game. He hasn’t played too many text adventure games but has played a lot of games. He noted the reason he likes playing video games is for the freedom to be creative and explore a new world. He also likes a good story to stay interested in the game. He said, “ Make red dead into a text adventure game ” and he would be interested. The other key point to note is that he likes games to be replayable and branching. He likes to be able to play a game a few times and be able to fully immersive and explore the world. He said that a game in the fantasy realm would be pretty generic but something like sci-fi has a lot of potential. The immersion and exploration we seem to get nailed down but need to work on branching narrative and replayability.


Interview 2:
I interviewed Max Curtiss at 7:00 pm on February 16, 2020. We talked about why Max liked gaming and what it added to his life. He likes the aspects of gaming that lets him distract his mind and pass the time. He said it can be a good break from things like homework. He says fluid gameplay is important - good UI and not feeling clunky. Having content that is non-repetitive is also something that is important to him. He said he likes the 1920's with a good story line maybe something detective related similar to L.A. Noire. If playing a text adventure, he says prompts can seem limiting and he likes the aspect of having multiple approaches to problems that are faced. This validated our hypotheses that people play games to pass the time and be distracted. Good UI and fluid interaction with an app is another thing that was validated that seems to be important to the user.

Interview 3:
I interviewed Gordon Hageman at 7:30 pm on February 16, 2020. He said that he plays games to distract his time in a playful manner. In a text adventure game he would like to be able to play through multiple paths and have variety in gameplay. Being able to play the game multiple times and have different story lines would be something he looks for in a game. He appreciates custimization and having a feeling that his character has authority over what is happening in the game. He says that a sci-fi game would be most interesting to him. If possible being able to process the users own inputs is something he would like to see but otherwise choosing from pre determined prompts would still work. Again this validated our hypotheses that people play games to alleviate boredom. 

Assessment: Nice to have
