###5. MVP
For creating our MVP our main strategy will be to reference our interviews and observe overlapping opinions for deciding what to implement. Frequent specifications about important aspects in the game will be key to our MVP. Things such as smooth and intuitive UI as well as story immersion are common themes in all of our interviews thus far and are considered important to our MVP.
More interviews may be necessary to get a larger amount of opinions regarding features. With the current focus being on the user interface and the story, we will plan to develop the UI first for demoing and testing.
