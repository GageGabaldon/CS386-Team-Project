You walk up to the pile of clothes suspicious about the only other thing up here and the weird shape it is in. You look through hte clothes. You find a small dark key that seems to be made of the same material as the platform.
Other than that the clothes don't appear to be yours and seem rather ordinary. Other than the fact that they seemed to be in a weird place.
