Interviews summary:

Gage's Interview 1: I interviewed Brian Bingham at 9:30 pm on February 14, 2020. I talked with Brian about our text adventure game. He hasn’t played too many text adventure games but has played a lot of games. He noted the reason he likes playing video games is for the freedom to be creative and explore a new world. He also likes a good story to stay interested in the game. He said, “ Make red dead into a text adventure game ” and he would be interested. The other key point to note is that he likes games to be replayable and branching. He likes to be able to play a game a few times and be able to fully immersive and explore the world. He said that a game in the fantasy realm would be pretty generic but something like sci-fi has a lot of potential. The immersion and exploration we seem to get nailed down but need to work on branching narrative and replayability.

Assessment of Brian: Nice to have

Tommy's Interview 1: I interviewed Max Curtiss at 7:00 pm on February 16, 2020. We talked about why Max liked gaming and what it added to his life. He likes the aspects of gaming that lets him distract his mind and pass the time. He said it can be a good break from things like homework. He says fluid gameplay is important - good UI and not feeling clunky. Having content that is non-repetitive is also something that is important to him. He said he likes the 1920's with a good story line maybe something detective related similar to L.A. Noire. If playing a text adventure, he says prompts can seem limiting and he likes the aspect of having multiple approaches to problems that are faced. This validated our hypotheses that people play games to pass the time and be distracted. Good UI and fluid interaction with an app is another thing that was validated that seems to be important to the user.

Tommy's Interview 2: I interviewed Gordon Hageman at 7:30 pm on February 16, 2020. He said that he plays games to distract his time in a playful manner. In a text adventure game he would like to be able to play through multiple paths and have variety in gameplay. Being able to play the game multiple times and have different story lines would be something he looks for in a game. He appreciates custimization and having a feeling that his character has authority over what is happening in the game. He says that a sci-fi game would be most interesting to him. If possible being able to process the users own inputs is something he would like to see but otherwise choosing from pre determined prompts would still work. Again this validated our hypotheses that people play games to alleviate boredom.

Elijah's Interview 1: I interviewed Christian Gabriel Bito-on on the 13th of February at 8:30pm Christian is mainly a gamer so I would assume that these would be our most important customers. Based on this interview, his archtype is that he prefers text-adventure games with extra added features and its shock factor. Because of these traits, he believes that it adds up to the immersion of the game, which helps to the main idea of games itself--to escape reality. When asked if a map or an inventory screen would only serve as clutter to the screen, he replied with no, and gave a suggestion about drop-down menus that can be utilized to minimize the clutter.

This interview provided me the clarification that text-adventure games provides the setting to escape reality, gamers should be our target audience for this game, and that map or inventory on the screen is not a problem as long as we implement something to prevent it from being so.

Must have: narrative aspect provides a sense of escaped reality, fourth-wall breaking, shock factor, drop-down menus, push icons Nice to have: Easy to pick up, other features adds another layer of immersion, a good story line, voice input, his major Don't care: general smoothness, his other hobbies

Vidal's Interview 1: I interviewed with Anthony, the morning of February 11th. Anthony has never really had interest in text adventure games. He feels there are better types of games. I then asked what he liked about other types of games and in response he told me they were good for escaping reality and doing fun things. He said he didn't really know exactly how to say it, but explained that he enjoyed doing things he doesn't do in the real world. He enjoys being able to act as he pleases without worrying about consequences like you would in real life. I asked him what he liked for features in a game or what he would like to see in a text adventure. He said he wanted things to matter in a game, as in the actions he makes should have an affect. He wants what he does to be impactful. Because I was understanding he was using games for an escape, I asked him what themes he liked. Did the game need to be set in something different from our reality, something fantasy? He said he did not care about the setting, but he wanted it to be serious. He didn't like games that were jokie or silly. Anthony said he liked the idea of having an option to type in what you say to include "hidden" options that are not explicitly offered. He likes the idea of being able to string together sentences from available words. He also stated that for a phone, including buttons to open up menus would be needed to avoid clutter if we included an inventory system or map to be able to view. Finally I asked him about if he wanted player customizability as this was to be a first person perspective game where he said it only mattered to have that option if we made stupid design choices that he would be required to use. To him, stupid meant silly, nonserious characters. I asked him this, because I was considering if he use some system for roles you can select, would that be something that mattered to players. I learned that a focus on a serious and interesting story driven game with continuity is what Anthony wants if he were to play a text adventure. There is little interest in specific themes or roles the player is set in from the start. Games are definitely important for entertainment and preventing boredom. Impact and interaction in a game is important. Creativity may not be so important to some people.

Vidal's Interview 2: I interviewed with Alyssa on February 13th in the afternoon. She said she has never played a text adventure game, but likes the idea of the "choose your own adventure" aspect behind it. She wants a story to be detailed and full of choices. She wants fantasy themes in her games, because it is different from reality. I asked her about interaction with the game and she said she liked to be able to type out an action only because it makes her feel as though she is more submerged in the game and the decision was her own. She likes the idea of customization in a game and being able to reimagine herself as different characters, in other words to be able to play a role different from her real life one. She overall said she wants something fun and distracting, something to get invested in. She likes the idea of a book that lets her choose the path which I enjoy, because the concept of that intriguing. Alyssa enjoys some video games, but also enjoys fantasy worlds and writing. It makes me wonder if our audience could include those who like to read fictional stories, not just those who play video games. Entertainment is important, but she didn't specify its need to prevent boredom. She wants to have impact and choices in the world however. Creativity may be slightly important to her, but she never specified it as something she valued. I am thinking that a well told or possibly only well described story could be important.
