### 1. Introduction
TextAdventureGame is a text adventure game that allows gamers to pass time and reduce boredom. The game encourages creativity through personal choice to determine the path the story leads. Players will have the opportunity to play something more open-ended and thought provoking than most mainstream games currently available.
  
At any given point in the game, the user will have a text prompt displayed on the screen that will lead them to choose from 4 different options. Each individual choice decides where the user will end up and determines what the next story prompt will be. The user will be able to play through multiple different story lines in the same game that ultimately lead them to the end.

### 2. Implemented requirements
1. We implemented a way for the user to personalize their own game experience by allowing the player to create their own character with a name of their choice and other componenets such as a morality score and an inventory.

2. We made progress implementing stories into our game. This is shown in our main game and is the story and the text that the user will interact with.

### 3. Demo

### 4. Code Quality
In terms of code quality the biggest thing we were concerned with was maintaining readable code that we would all understand and be able to work off of individually. In practice this included keeping similar styling conventions such as uniformly indented code blocks and use of camel case in naming of methods, variables, etc. 

Along with this we used Git's pull requests as a way for our QA to ensure that updates stayed uniform to the conventions we had been using. We also made it a point to document code that may be confusing at first with descriptive comments that help someone other than the author explictly understand what is happening. By following these practices and working together as a team, we have been able to maintain high quality code.

### 5. Lessons Learned
One lesson that we learned as we were working on this implementation is that it can be hard to work as a team on a project such as this. We had individual people working on individual parts of the project and it was difficult at some points to coordinate what each team member was doing. At some points it was difficult to progess and work on other parts of the project without finishing what needs to be done first.

Another lesson that we have learned throughout the entirety of this team project is to start early. As we had discussed in class, projects can take a lot longer than expected to complete as necessary. We did get better about starting earlier on deliverables and implementations. When working on this second implementation we ran into a lot of small issues that needed discussion that we did not expect to run into initially. A lot of this discussion takes time to fully understand the system as a whole. Things seemed to go a lot smoother when we started earlier and gave ourselves enough headroom to run into problems.
