SSSSrrrrrrrrrccccccchhhh!!! You bolt up from your bed in a flash with your heart pumping and echoing throughout your ears. You
look around in amazement and see that your bed is not in your house. Instead it seems to be on top of a large grey metal structure some distance into the air with big grey clouds surrounding you like a wall.
Upon calming down you begin to ask yourself what happened when you went to sleep. You cant seem to recall anything that happened before you woke up.
You search the area shivering as you do so from the cold.
You find the scratch marks on the floor that appears to be what woke you up. Aside from that you see a small hap of clothes and a somewhat sturdy
rope hanging of the edge of this building.
