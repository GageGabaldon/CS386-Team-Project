### 1. Introduction
  TextAdventureGame is a text adventure game that allows gamers to pass time and reduce boredom. The game encourages creativity through personal choice to determine the path the story leads. Players will have the opportunity to play something more open-ended and thought provoking than most mainstream games currently available.
  
  At any given point in the game, the user will have a text prompt displayed on the screen that will lead them to choose from 4 different options. Each individual choice decides where the user will end up and determines what the next story prompt will be. The user will be able to play through multiple different story lines in the same game that ultimately lead them to the end.
