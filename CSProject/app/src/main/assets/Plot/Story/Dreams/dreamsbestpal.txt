You decide to see what the creature is all about. As the door opens you gaze upon a cloud in a humanoid shape. As the cloud makes its way out the door it stops right in front of you and whispers in your ear.
"Hey". You startled a bit that a cloud just said hey, you reel back a bit and mutter the words "Sup". The cloud starts then starts shuttering and a gurgle of
little thundering emits from the creature much like a laugh. He then speaks again saying, "What are you doing here".
