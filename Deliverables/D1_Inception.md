Introduction:

We are developing a text adventure game. We want a immersive world that tries to help the player solve problems in creative and fun ways. 



Initial value proposition and consumer segments: 

Inital value proposition is that for escapisim, need to create.



Interviews summary:
I interviwed Christian Gabriel Bito-on on the 13th of February at 8:30pm
Christian is mainly a gamer so I would assume that these would be our
most important customers. Based on this interview, his archtype is that he
prefers text-adventure games with extra added features and its shock factor.
Because of these traits, he believes that it adds up to the immersion of the game, 
which helps to the main idea of games itself--to escape reality.
When asked if a map or an inventory screen would only serve as clutter
to the screen, he replied with no, and gave a suggestion about drop-down 
menus that can be utilized to minimize the clutter.

This interview provided me the clarification that text-adventure games 
provides the setting to escape reality, gamers should be our target audience
for this game, and that map or inventory on the screen is not a problem as 
long as we implement something to prevent it from being so.

Must have:
narrative aspect provides a sense of escaped reality, fourth-wall breaking, shock factor, drop-down menus, push icons
Nice to have:
Easy to pick up, other features adds another layer of immersion, a good story line, voice input, his major
Don't care:
general smoothness, his other hobbies


Final value proposition and consumer segments:

What your product is - A text-adventure game
The target customer - GAMERS
The value you provide - Escaped Reality with immersion
Why your product is unique - A text-adventure game that provides the same level if not more 
than the same level of immersion as the most sophisticated games out there (;
