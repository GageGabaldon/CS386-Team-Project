### 1. Introduction
  TextAdventureGame is a text adventure game that allows gamers to pass time and reduce boredom. The game encourages creativity through personal choice to determine the path the story leads. Players will have the opportunity to play something more open-ended and thought provoking than most mainstream games currently available.
  
  At any given point in the game, the user will have a text prompt displayed on the screen that will lead them to choose from 4 different options. Each individual choice decides where the user will end up and determines what the next story prompt will be. The user will be able to play through multiple different story lines in the same game that ultimately lead them to the end.

### 2. Implemented requirements

### 4. Code Quality
  In terms of code quality the biggest thing we were concerned with was maintaining readable code that we would all understand and be able to work off of individually. In practice this included keeping similar styling conventions such as uniformly indented code blocks and use of camel case in naming of methods, variables, etc. Along with this we used Git's pull requests as a way for our QA to ensure that updates stayed uniform to the conventions we had been using. We also made it a point to document code that may be confusing at first with descriptive comments that help someone other than the author explictly understand what is happening. By following these practices and working together as a team, we have been able to maintain high quality code.
